        This is a full-stack application that provides samples for handling data in a relational database with ORM
        and handling hierarchical data in the NgRx Store with NgRx Data.
      </p>

      <h4>Store hierarchical data in <i>normalized</i> form.</h4>
      The basic concepts of normalizing data are:
      <ul>
        <li>Each type of data gets its own "table" in the state.</li>
        <li>Each "data table" should store the individual items in an object, with the IDs of the items as keys and the items themselves as the values.</li>
        <li>Any references to individual items should be done by storing the item's ID.</li>
        <li>Arrays of IDs should be used to indicate ordering.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Convert normalized data from store into hierarchical form with selectors.</h4>
      <ul>
      </ul>
