      <h4>How to store hierarchical data into NgRx Store?</h4>
      Store hierarchical data in <i>normalized</i> form. The basic concepts of normalizing data are:
      <ul>
        <li>Each type of data gets its own "table" in the state.</li>
        <li>Each "data table" should store the individual items in an object, with the IDs of the items as keys and the items themselves as the values.</li>
        <li>Any references to individual items should be done by storing the item's ID.</li>
        <li>Arrays of IDs should be used to indicate ordering.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Howto render normalized data hierarchical?</h4>
      If you need normalized data in hierarchical form you can read and convert it with NgRx selectors.
